Program:
    The code contains a simple text editor written in java that allows you type in, open other text files and also search through text. Some functionalities of the text editor have not yet been coded, but it serves as a great basis for a more complicated text editor GUI application, given that most of the functionalities and examples are present.

Running the Code:
    Feel free to either copy and paste or download the code and use as you would like. A couple of functionalities might be added in the near future, which should hopefully allow me to also edit the fonts.
